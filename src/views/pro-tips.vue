            <p>Instead of paying for Dreamweaver, Use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/student/">PHP Storm or WebStorm</a>. It's free for students
                and has a ton of stuff that makes life easier. For example, instead of having to edit your changes in an FTP each time, you can <a href="https://imgur.com/a/538JNTS">set up a remote host</a>,
                then <a href="https://imgur.com/tEU1thB">Set where your files are</a>, add the credentials in once and have it automatically upload to the server and you can view your changes with the Click of a button </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Use <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> because dealing with CSS can be Hell sometimes. and SASS/SCSS makes it so much easier. You can nest things, use variables, and more. I don't know what I'd do without it!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If you don't already know, don't use Open Office. While you're a student you can get MS Office for free <a href="https://portal.office.com/">here!</a> Just sign in with your MSU email,
                And then click install office on the upper-right hand side of the screen.</p>
