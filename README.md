# My First Attempt at creating a Vue Site

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5e7579da-ce62-4fc4-af9b-15cb8bf936ed/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/suspicious-fermi-5fbcaa/deploys)

I made this site for a project for my CAS 204 class, but it looks pretty good so I think i'll keep it.
